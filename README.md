# moCtoDnozamA Client

This repository is for the front end client of a team built full-stack javascript application. It features Nozama, a mock e-commerce app. The client relies heavily on Javascript in order to make a seamless representation of browsing for items, adding an item to a cart, checking out (utilizing a third party API 'Stripe'), and looking at previous order history.

## TECHNOLOGIES IN USE

- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- AJAX
- jQuery
- Handlebars
- CSS/Bootstrap
- HTML5

## PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT

We made initial wireframes and an ERD for our prompt. We tried several different approaches when creating our API. The first attempt, we found that we had a lot of nested data that was difficult to mentally parse, and decided to scrap the whole idea and create four models reflecting each part of our website. It taught us a lot about what /not/ to do, which in turn allowed us to learn from our mistakes and ultimately improve our skeletal design.
